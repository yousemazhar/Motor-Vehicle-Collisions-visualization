##  Project Overview

This project is part of **Data Engineering & Visualization – Milestone 1**.
We built an **interactive analytical dashboard** for *NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions* using:
* **Python**
* **Gradio**
* **Plotly**
* **Pandas**
* **Integrated Crash + Person datasets**
* **Natural-Language Smart Search**
* **Dynamic visual reports (9 charts + summary)**

The dashboard supports **real-time filtering**, **trend analysis**, **heatmaps**, **distribution visualizations**, and **geospatial mapping** with a responsive UI deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

#  Data Engineering Summary 

## **1. Data Sources**

We used the official NYC Open Data resources:

* **Crashes dataset**
  [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)
* **Person dataset**
  [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu)

Integrated using **COLLISION_ID**.

---

## **2. Pre-Integration Cleaning**

Cleaning steps completed before joining:

### **✔ Handling missing values**

* Dropped unusable rows (missing primary identifiers)
* Imputed minor categorical noise using consistent labels (e.g., vehicle types)
* Converted date and time fields into:

    * `CRASH_YEAR`
    * `CRASH_MONTH`
    * `CRASH_DAYOFWEEK`
    * `CRASH_HOUR`

### **✔ Removing outliers**

* Removed invalid coordinates (lat < 40 or lat > 41)
* Removed invalid ages and impossible numeric values

### **✔ Standardization**

* Uniform case normalization (vehicle types, person types, borough names)
* Standard date formatting

---

## **3. Integration Step**

**Joined Crash + Person datasets** using `COLLISION_ID`.

### After join, performed:

* Removal of duplicate joined records
* Consistency checks between injury fields
* Standardization of categorical values
* Clean-up of redundant columns

Final integrated dataset saved as:

`nyc_crashes_integrated_clean.parquet`

---

## **📊 Visualizations Included**

The dashboard generates **9 interactive charts**:

1. Trend analysis (line chart)
2. Person type distribution (pie)
3. Categorical analysis (bar)
4. Time distribution (bar)
5. Contributing factor analysis – vehicle 1
6. Contributing factor analysis – vehicle 2
7. Injury & fatality rate comparison
8. Day × hour heatmap
9. Geographic crash map

Plus a full **summary statistics section** and **insights under every visualization**.

---

# Smart Search Capability

The app supports **natural-language queries**, such as:

* “Brooklyn 2022 pedestrian crashes”
* “Manhattan weekend taxi injuries”
* “Queens Friday night motorcycle fatalities”

The smart parser automatically detects:

* Borough
* Year
* Month
* Day of week
* Time of day
* Vehicle type
* Person type
* Severity
* Gender

#  Local Setup Instructions

### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yousemazhar/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-visualization.git
cd https://github.com/yousemazhar/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-visualization.git
```

### **2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run the app locally**

```bash
python app.py
```

The dashboard opens automatically at:
 **[http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860)**

#  Deployment Instructions , Hugging Face Spaces

Deploying to HF Spaces is easy and requires only:

* `app.py`
* `requirements.txt`
* the dataset (`.parquet`)

### **1. Create a New Space**

Go to:
[https://huggingface.co/spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)

Choose:

* **Space type:** Gradio
* **Hardware:** CPU
* **Visibility:** Public (or Private)

### **2. Upload the project files**

Upload:

```
app.py
nyc_crashes_integrated_clean.parquet
requirements.txt
```

Your `requirements.txt` should include at minimum:

```
gradio
pandas
plotly
numpy
pyarrow
```

### **3. Commit and wait for the build**

Hugging Face automatically:

* installs dependencies
* runs `app.py`
* launches your Space

### **4. Access the Live App**

It will appear at:

```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/<username>/<space-name>
```

#  Testing After Deployment

Verify that:

✔ UI loads correctly
✔ “Smart Search” auto-fills filters
✔ “Generate Report” renders all charts
✔ Map loads correctly
✔ Reset button restores all defaults
✔ Performance is stable with filters
